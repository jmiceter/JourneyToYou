# JourneyToYou
Track pregnancy journey. What to expect and see the stage of the baby.
JourneyToYou is a cross-platform (iOS + Android) pregnancy-timeline app built with **Expo** and **React Native**.  
The goal of the app is to show the stages of fetal development with a warm, welcoming experience and simple navigation.

This project is currently in early development.
